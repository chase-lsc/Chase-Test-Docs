### Overview of Task Automation With Excel Macros

Welcome to our Excel Macro guide. Here we will walk you through the steps of creating a few convenient Excel Macros to automate common data entry tasks in the office.

The instructions we have made in this guide include:
- creating and saving a custom Excel Macro
- creating a Macro for organizing and sorting imported data
- creating a Macro for splitting and combining text columns
- creating a Macro for removing blanks and repetitive texts

### How We Collaborated Together

We brainstormed and decided on the topic and the main instructions together. Then we decided on the typographs and formats to use before dividing up the tasks and getting to work.

Due to the coronavirus, the school has switched to online classrooms completely. To keep communications clear, we kept close and timely contact on Slack and we notified each other of any changes that might affect the other teammate's work.

We exchanged ideas and collaborated on troubleshooting technical problems in regards to using Markdown with other groups as well as with the instructor. Group problem solving played a huge role in completing this team writing excercise remotely.


### How We Created Our Guide

We used technical writing skills we learned this term to guide our writing style and format. We used various official Excel user manuals, personal Excel blogs, Excel forums and other online resources to further familiarize ourselves with Excel and its Macro features.

#### Using Markdown

Markdown was a brand new tool introduced to us with this writing excercise.

Neither of us has used or even heard of Markdown before. But thankfully we are no strangers to markup languages and we were able to understand its usage pretty quickly.

By transfering and applying our HTML knowledge and by noticing the little differences in syntax between Markdown and HTML, we were able to implement Markdown's various formatting syntax with minimal issues.

#### Using Word

The main program we both used to write up the body of this user documentation was Microsoft Word. We could have used a dedicated code editor but we felt that that was not necessary. We just needed the body texts done in any word editor and we can do the markup language coding directly on GitHub, thanks to GitHub's convenient "Preview changes".

#### Using a Theme

We used Just the Docs for the theme of this user documentation. Just the Docs is a responsive Jekyll theme with a built-in sidebar and search function. By using a premade theme, we saved a lot of time from trying to come up with our own CSS from scratch.

We forked the master repo of Just the Docs and edited the yaml files to fit the layout and titles to our own guide.

### Conclusion

Team writing is always challenge. Different people have different ideas of the topic, the content format, the style, the tone and so on. Trying to work out the differences and reaching a uniform decision is a great test for communication skills and collaboration skills. This was made more difficult by the current situation of having to do all of this remotely, but we managed to pull through.

In this excercise, we utilized our own familiarity with online communications to stay connected and updated. We worked with not just ourselves but with other groups as well to get past obstacles. We were able to complete our goals in a timely manner without having to sacrifice our numerous other ongoing assignments. 

As a result of this writing this guide, we learned a new use of markup languages in the form of writing user documentations, we became more familiar with Excel's Macro features and we further developed our collaboration skills. Overall, we were satisfied with the results of this writing excercise.

Thank you for using our Excel Macro guide and we hope you found these automation Macros useful for your work.
