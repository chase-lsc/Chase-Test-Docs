## Task 4

### Conciseness Helps Web Readers

Research has shown that people typically spend less than 15 seconds on a website.

If they can't find what they were looking for or if they can't become interested in those 15 seconds, they will move on.

As a web user myself, I can confirm that this is my behaviour as well.

Simple and concise writing help get your point across easier and faster, making it more likely for people to actually read what you wanted to say.

Like this:

>Our Web site has made available many of the things you can use for making a decision on the best dentist. 

`Our website presents criteria for determining the best dentist.`

>At this point in time we canâ€™t ascertain the reason as to why the screen door was left open.

`We haven't figured out why the screen door was left open.`

>There is a desire on the part of many of us to maintain a spring break for the purpose of getting away from the demands of our studies.

`Many of us want a spring break so we can take a break from our studies.`

## Task 5 Code Blocks Make Me Happy

```java
// a Class that creates Corona objects with one method explaining what it is
public class Corona {
  public void whatIsIt() {
    System.out.println("A popular pale lager produced by Cerveceria Modelo in Mexico and owned by AB InBev in Belgium.")
  }
```

```python
